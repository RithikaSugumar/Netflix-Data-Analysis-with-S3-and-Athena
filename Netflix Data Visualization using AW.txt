How the Project Works
1. Netflix CSV file is uploaded to S3
2. External table is created in Athena
3. Lambda function triggers Athena queries
4. Query results are stored in S3
5. Data is verified using SQL queries

How to Verify
- Run 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix;' in Athena
- Trigger Lambda function and check CloudWatch logs
